#SSLSTripWire
SSL Strip Wire is an attempt to create a browser extension to help augment
the fact that we are human when it comes to noticing encryption security
on websites. The objective is to create a plugin that will recognize when
something out of the ordinary is occuring with regards to encryption on
websites you have visited in the past.
